                  Dublin (individual manuscript numbers appear in the witness list below).

                              <p>Saint Eloi, one of the most popular Saints of the Middle Ages,
                                 founded a monastery near the present village of Mont St. Eloi, five miles
                                 northwest of the city of Arras in northern France. The ruins of the monastery
                                 remain, and in 1917-18 were close to the Western Front. There is also a British
                                 Military Cemetery nearby.

                                       Both men were drafted to the same division in France. MacGreevy was assigned to
                                       guns, Taylor to trench mortars: 'the greatest misfortune that could befall a
                                       gunner-officer. Trench mortars were regarded with horror . . . [they were] a

                                       Manchester, he found Taylor's name in the Died of Wounds section of the
                                       Casualty List. The death of Geoffrey Taylor, 'one of the most sensitively
                                       gentle' of men, represented to MacGreevy the worst horror of war: the
                                       destruction of 'life's hopes and dreams'; 'intelligence and beauty'.
